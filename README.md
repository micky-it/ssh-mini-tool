# SSh-mini-tool
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micky-it/ssh-mini-tool/main/images/image.jpg)


Hi! I created this program for people who are unfamiliar with the terminal or who don't want to waste time writing a command. This program includes the following commands:
- Shutdown 
- reboot 
- notification
- shell 
of a computer on the network. **(The computer on the network must have the openssh-server package installed to work)**

- **Some fix, 32 bit version and Mac OS version coming soon!**



## Dependencies

To use this program you must first install the dependencies by writing these commands on the terminal:

`$ sudo apt-get install openssh-client`

**On the computer on the network where the commands will be executed, the following package must be installed with this command:**

`$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server`


## How to install and use

To install this package you must first download the files with the following command or download the zip:

`$ sudo git clone https://github.com/micky-it/ssh-mini-tool.git && cd ssh-mini-tool`

To install the program write in the terminal:

`$ sudo ./install.sh`

***Now the program is installed! To use it write `ssh-mini-tool` in the terminal. Good use!***

To uninstall the program write in the terminal:

`$ sudo ./uninstall.sh`
